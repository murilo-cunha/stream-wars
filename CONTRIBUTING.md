# Contributing

Thanks for your contribution! Some small points to consider before suggesting changes.

We use `poetry` for packaging and environment management. Additionally, please use the `pre-commit` package and the hooks predefined. They ensure certain checks.

```console
git clone git@github.com:murilo-cunha/stream-wars.git
cd stream-wars
poetry shell
poetry install
pre-commit install
```

Thanks again for contributing! Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions/suggestions! ðŸš€
